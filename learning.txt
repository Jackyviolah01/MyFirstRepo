In this course, I have learned how to use Git and GitHub to manage my projects more efficiently. I now understand how to clone repositories, make changes locally, commit updates, and sync them with remote repositories. This knowledge has helped me appreciate the importance of version control in collaborative work and has boosted my confidence in handling real-world development tasks.
