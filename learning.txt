What I have learned from this course is how to use Git and GitHub to manage my projects more effectively. I have gained hands-on experience with cloning repositories, creating and editing files locally, committing changes, and pushing them to a remote repository. This has helped me understand the importance of version control and how it supports collaboration in real-world software development.
